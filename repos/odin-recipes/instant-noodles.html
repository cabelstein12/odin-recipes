    <h3>Facts about this dish:</h3>

    <p>
        <em>From Wikipedia:</em> Instant noodles, or instant ramen, 
        is a type of food consisting of noodles sold in a precooked 
        and dried block with flavoring powder and/or seasoning oil. 
        The dried noodle block was originally created by flash-frying cooked noodles, 
        and this is still the main method used in Asian countries; air-dried 
        noodle blocks are favored in Western countries. Dried noodle blocks 
        are designed to be cooked or soaked in boiling water before eating. 
        Ramen, a Japanese adaptation of Chinese noodle soup, is sometimes used
         as a descriptor for instant noodle flavors by some Japanese manufacturers. 
         It has become synonymous in the United States with all instant noodle products.
