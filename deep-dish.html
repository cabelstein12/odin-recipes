    <h3>Facts about this dish:</h3>

    <p>
        <em>From Wikipedia:</em> According to Tim Samuelson, 
            Chicago's official cultural historian, there 
            is not enough documentation to determine with certainty 
            who invented Chicago-style deep-dish pizza.
             It is often reported that Chicago-style deep-dish 
             pizza was invented at Pizzeria Uno in Chicago, in 1943, 
             by Uno's founder Ike Sewell. However, a 1956 article from the 
             Chicago Daily News asserts that Uno's original pizza chef 
             Rudy Malnati developed the recipe, and Michele Mohr from 
             the Chicago Tribune reports that the menu at Rosati's Authentic 
             Chicago Pizza has included deep-dish since it opened in 1926, 
            according to the descendants of Saverio Rosati.
